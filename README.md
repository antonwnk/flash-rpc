# Adobe Flash Discord Rich Presence

Adobe Flash Discord Rich Presence is a program written in Python to let all of your friends know what cool & awesome Flash game you're playing!

### Please don't clone the repository if you're on Windows, get the program from "Releases" https://github.com/dooji2/flash-rpc/releases/

# ‚ö†Ô∏èRequirements‚ö†Ô∏è

1. Ensure you have the latest version of Python. 
2. Make sure you are using Adobe Flash to play your games, not inside your browser. For example, I'm using a standalone version of Adobe Flash. It should work with any version.
3. If you're on Windows, download the executable from "Releases". If you're on Linux, clone the repository and run "flash-rpc.py", the same goes if you're on macOS.
